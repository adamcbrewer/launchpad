### Web Boilerplate

This ain't no [H5BP](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate). Rather it's meant as a rapid, lightweight place from which to start a new project. Mostly everything I use in my daily workflow is included, with a few optimisations and useful helpers collected from around the web. Attributions are given where relevant/possible.

##### To get started:

1. Clone this project
2. Run ```bower install``` to install the latest versions or the required components
3. Run ```grunt``` to get up and running (install bower components to the ```assets/js/libs``` directory)


##### From around the web

* HTML5BP
* Modernizr
* LESS
* Facebook Open Graph meta stuff
* Basic namespacing
* .htaccess file in /assets for delivering gziped css/js files, if apache is configured to handle gzipping
